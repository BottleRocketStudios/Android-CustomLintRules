# CustomLintRules
## What this library does?
This library currently provides the following lint rules that detect unsupported characters in source and xml files:

 * `TrojanSourceDetector` - covers Java and Kotlin files
 * `TrojanXmlDetector` - covers XML resource and Android manifest files

A fatal lint error will be reported if any unicode (or unsupported ascii) characters are detected. Only printable(`32..126`) + horizontal tab/line feed/carriage return(`9`, `10`, `13`) ascii characters are allowed.

## Sample characters that will cause a lint error 
* BIDI symbols: `LRE`, `RLE`, `LRO`, `RLO`, `LRI`, `RLI`, `FSI`, `PDF`, `PDI` (some of the actual symbols ‚Å¶‚Åß‚Å©‚ÄÆ)
    * See https://trojansource.codes/trojan-source.pdf for more details
* Homoglyphs such as –ù ([cyrillic en](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_(Cyrillic)))
* Symbols such as ‚Ç¨ or üëç
* Ascii control characters: `0..31` and `127`
